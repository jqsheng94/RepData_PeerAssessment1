## Loading and preprocessing the data
##### 1. Load the data into R
```r
activity <- read.csv("C:/Users/jiaqi/Desktop/activity.csv")
View(activity)
```
##### 2. Transfer the data into propriate format for analyzing




## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

First is using aggregate function
```r
Total_steps=aggregate(steps ~ date, data = activity, sum, na.rm = TRUE)
```
Then construct a histogram for total number steps taken per day
```r
hist(Total_steps$steps, main = "The number of Steps by Day", xlab = "day", col="skyblue", border=F,  breaks=20)
```
![Sample panel plot](instructions_fig/sample_panelplot.png)

And then calculate the median and average value 

```r
Average=mean(Total_steps$steps)
Average
## [1] 10766.19
Median=median(Total_steps$steps)
Median
## [1] 10765
```

So the mean is 10766.19 and median is 10765


## What is the average daily activity pattern?
Make a time series plot (i.e. type = “l”) of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis)
Now I get mean of steps and time series plot
time_series=tapply(activity$steps, activity$interval, mean, na.rm = TRUE)
The plot is:
```r
plot(row.names(time_series), time_series, type = "l", xlab = "5 minutes interval", 
+      ylab = "Average across all Days", main = "Time Series Plot", 
+      col = "red", lwd=3, ylim=c(0,250))
```
Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of steps?
```r
max_interval=which.max(time_series)
names(max_interval)
## [1] "835"
```


## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
